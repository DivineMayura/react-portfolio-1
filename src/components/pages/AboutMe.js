                </h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a twenty one year old full stack web developer and a certified pilot!  <br /><br />
                    I have a very wide skill set, I love learning new things, and I want to use those skills for awesome things. <br /><br />
                    After I graduated high school, I went to acquire my pilotâ€™s license. <br />
                    Upon receiving my certificate I attended a community college in Eureka California for a year. <br /> 
                    Then I attended and graduated UC Berkeley's full stack web development bootcamp, and now I'm looking for a job!!
